# seismic-hazard-forecasting
Seismic hazard forecasting for Turkey using AFAD data. Includes data cleaning, completeness estimation, Gutenberg Richter modelling, declustering and a space time ETAS model. Spatial forecasts use a strain weighted field so locations near active faults have higher influence and more realistic patterns.
